### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm opdo, a student majoring in Data Science with a concentration in Business Analytics.
I'm also a n00b programmer, hoping to expand my skills through practice and projects :)

My GitHub is where I (plan to) store all of my programming-related work. If anything piques your interest, feel free to reach out!

Happy programming,
@netfledgling
